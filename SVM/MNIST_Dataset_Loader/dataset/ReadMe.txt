Unzip and Place your dataset files here in the dataset folder.

There should be four files with these names (make sure the names match):

dataset
|_ train-images.idx3-ubyte
|_ train-labels.idx1-ubyte
|_ t10k-images.idx3-ubyte
|_ t10k-labels.idx1-ubyte
 You need to download train-images.idx3-ubyte, because it is a large file and cannot be uploaded.
 Use the link below to download it, extract it and then place it into the SVM/MNIST_Dataset_Loader/dataset.
